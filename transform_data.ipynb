    "Note: TextFlint mentions that these universal transformations are not always compatible with some tasks, so we must be careful in applying them \"universally\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* **BackTrans**: BackTrans (Trans short for translation) replaces test data with paraphrases by leveraging back translation, which is able to figure out whether or not the target models merely capture the literal features instead of semantic meaning.\n",
    "* **InsertAdv**: Transforms an input by add adverb word before verb\n",
    "* **AppendIrr**: Extend sentences by irrelevant sentences\n",
    "* **WordCase**: Transform an input to upper and lower case or capitalize case.\n",
    "* **Contraction**: Contraction replaces phrases like `will not` and `he has` with contracted forms, namely, `won’t` and `he’s`\n",
    "* **Keyboard**: Keyboard turn to the way how people type words and change tokens into mistaken ones with errors caused by the use of keyboard, like `word → worf` and `ambiguous → amviguius`.\n",
    "* **SwapNum**: Transforms an input by replacing the numbers in it.\n",
    "* **Ocr**: Transformation that simulate ocr error by random values.\n",
    "* **Punctuation**: Transforms input by add punctuation at the end of sentence.\n",
    "* **SpellingError**: Transformation that leverage pre-defined spelling mistake dictionary to simulate spelling mistake.\n",
    "* **Tense**: Transforms all verb tenses in sentence.\n",
    "* **TwitterType**: Transforms input by common abbreviations in TwitterType.\n",
    "* **Typos**: Randomly inserts, deletes, swaps or replaces a single letter within one word (Ireland → Irland).\n",
    "* **SwapSynWordEmbedding**: Transforms an input by replacing its words by Glove.\n",
    "* **SwapSynWordNet**: Transforms an input by replacing its words with synonyms provided by WordNet.\n",
    "* **Prejudice**: Transforms an input by Reverse gender or place names in sentences.\n",
    "* **MLMSuggestion**: MLMSuggestion (MLM short for masked language model) generates new sentences where one syntactic category element of the original sentence is replaced by what is predicted by masked language models.\n",
    "* **ReverseNeg**: Transforms an affirmative sentence into a negative sentence, or vice versa.\n",
    "* **SwapAntWordNet**: Transforms an input by replacing its words with antonym provided by WordNet.\n",
    "* **SwapNamedEnt**: Swap entities with other entities of the same category."
